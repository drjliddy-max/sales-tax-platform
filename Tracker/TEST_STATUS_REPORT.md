## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Areas

### Unit Test Categories:
- âœ… **Error Handling:** Message categorization, context inclusion
- âœ… **Webhook Delivery:** Success/failure scenarios, signature verification
- âœ… **Caching:** Storage/retrieval, TTL expiration, LRU eviction
- âœ… **Circuit Breaking:** State transitions, failure thresholds
- âœ… **Health Monitoring:** Request tracking, score calculations
