# Security Policy and Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Sales Tax Tracker application and provides guidance for maintaining security best practices.

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Static Code Analysis with Semgrep

We use **Semgrep** for automated security scanning to detect vulnerabilities in our codebase.

#### Automated Scanning Schedule:
- **On every push** to `main` and `develop` branches
- **On every pull request** to `main` and `develop` branches  
- **Daily scheduled scans** at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual triggers** available for ad-hoc security assessments

#### Security Rulesets Applied:
- `auto` - Semgrep's automatically selected rules
- `p/security-audit` - Comprehensive security audit rules
- `p/secrets` - Secret detection rules
- `p/owasp-top-ten` - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability rules
- `p/javascript` - JavaScript-specific security rules
- `p/typescript` - TypeScript-specific security rules
- `p/nodejs` - Node.js-specific security rules
- `p/react` - React-specific security rules
- `p/express` - Express.js-specific security rules

#### Key Vulnerabilities Addressed:
‚úÖ **Remote Property Injection** - Prototype pollution prevention  
‚úÖ **Path Traversal** - File path validation and sanitization  
‚úÖ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Input validation and output encoding  
‚úÖ **RegExp Denial of Service (ReDoS)** - Safe regex pattern implementation  
‚úÖ **Missing Subresource Integrity** - SRI attributes for external resources  
‚úÖ **Incomplete Sanitization** - Comprehensive input sanitization  
‚úÖ **Format String Injection** - Structured logging implementation  

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

A robust Content Security Policy has been implemented to prevent XSS attacks and other injection vulnerabilities.

#### CSP Features:
- **Strict script sources** with nonce-based execution
- **Image source restrictions** to prevent data exfiltration
- **Style source controls** for CSS injection prevention
- **Frame restrictions** to prevent clickjacking
- **Reporting endpoints** for CSP violation monitoring
- **Development-friendly configuration** with appropriate relaxations for dev environments

#### Implementation:
- CSP middleware in `src/middleware/csp.ts`
- Integrated into main server (`src/simple-server.ts`)
- Configurable for different environments
- Includes violation reporting for security monitoring

### 3. Structured Logging

Secure logging implementation to prevent format string injection attacks while maintaining comprehensive audit trails.

#### Features:
- **Format string injection prevention** - No direct user input in log messages
- **Structured context objects** - Safe parameter passing
- **Log level controls** - Appropriate sensitivity handling
- **Error context preservation** - Safe error object logging
- **Performance optimization** - Efficient logging operations

#### Implementation:
- Secure logger utility in `src/utils/SecureLogger.ts`
- Applied across critical services:
  - `src/services/ReportingService.ts`
  - `src/services/ComprehensiveReportingService.ts`
  - `src/services/insights/SmartInsightsService.ts`
  - `src/utils/Logger.ts`

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

Comprehensive input validation implemented across all user-facing endpoints and file operations.

#### Path Traversal Protection:
- **Filename sanitization** - Remove dangerous characters
- **Extension validation** - Whitelist allowed file types
- **Path resolution validation** - Ensure paths stay within allowed directories
- **Symbolic link protection** - Prevent symlink-based attacks

#### Request Body Sanitization:
- **Prototype pollution prevention** - Safe object merging
- **Input validation** - Type and format checking
- **XSS prevention** - HTML encoding and validation
- **SQL injection prevention** - Parameterized queries (where applicable)

### 5. Dependency Security

Regular dependency scanning and vulnerability management.

#### Tools Used:
- **npm audit** - Built-in npm vulnerability scanner
- **TruffleHog** - Secret detection in dependencies and code history
- **Semgrep supply chain** - Third-party package vulnerability detection

#### Process:
- Automated dependency scans on every build
- Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Dependency pinning for reproducible builds
- Security advisories monitoring

## üö® Security Incident Response

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue** - Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately
2. **Email the security team** at security@company.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes
3. **Allow time for assessment** - We aim to respond within 24-48 hours
4. **Coordinate disclosure** - We'll work with you on responsible disclosure timing

### Security Alert Process

When security scans detect critical issues:

1. **Automatic alerts** are sent for critical vulnerabilities in main branch
2. **Security team notification** via configured channels
3. **Immediate assessment** of vulnerability impact
4. **Hotfix deployment** for critical security issues
5. **Post-incident review** and process improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Security Guidelines

### For Developers

#### Before Committing Code:
```bash
# Run security scan locally
semgrep --config=auto --error frontend/src/

# Check for secrets
git secrets --scan

# Run dependency audit
npm audit
cd frontend && npm audit
```

#### Secure Coding Practices:
1. **Never hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Assume all user input is malicious
3. **Sanitize outputs** - Encode data before rendering
4. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
5. **Implement proper error handling** - Don't leak sensitive information
6. **Follow principle of least privilege** - Minimal required permissions
7. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update to latest secure versions

#### Code Review Security Checklist:
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding applied where needed
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and secure
- [ ] Logging doesn't include sensitive data

### For Operations

#### Deployment Security:
- Use HTTPS in all environments
- Implement proper certificate management
- Configure secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Monitor security scan results
- Maintain incident response procedures

#### Infrastructure Security:
- Regular security updates for server OS
- Network segmentation and firewalls
- Access control and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Security monitoring and alerting

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring:
- **Daily Semgrep scans** with result archival
- **GitHub Security Advisory monitoring**
- **Dependency vulnerability alerts**
- **CSP violation reporting**
- **Application security logs monitoring**

### Security Metrics:
- Number of security vulnerabilities by severity
- Time to remediation for security issues  
- Security scan coverage percentage
- Dependency update frequency
- Security incident response times

### Dashboard and Reporting:
- Security scan results available in GitHub Security tab
- SARIF reports generated for detailed analysis
- Security summary comments on pull requests
- Artifact retention for audit purposes

## üîÑ Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- **Weekly**: Review security scan results and dependency updates
- **Monthly**: Security configuration review and updates
- **Quarterly**: Threat model review and security assessment
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit and penetration testing

### Update Process:
1. Monitor security advisories for used technologies
2. Test security updates in development environment
3. Deploy critical security fixes immediately
4. Schedule non-critical security updates with regular releases
5. Document all security-related changes
