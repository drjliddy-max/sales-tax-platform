A business valuation might include an analysis of the company's management, its capital structure, its future earnings prospects, or the market value of its assets.\n\nBusinesses are valued for different reasons - someone wants to buy the business, or you want to sell your business, or you want to establish a value in case you lose your business in a disaster. There are several ways to value a business:\n\nWhat the Term \"Multiples\" Means\n\nThe term \"multiples\" has a specific meaning in business finance. A multiple is a way to measure one element of the financial status of a company by comparing two metrics (relevant numbers). Because businesses are different, multiples and ratios are used for comparisons between unlike companies, rather than using definite numbers.\n\nA multiple is a fraction in which the top number (the numerator) is larger than the bottom number (the denominator). One common multiple is the price/earnings ratio, which measures stock price to earnings. P/E ratio tells what the market (stock buyers) are willing to pay for the company's earnings.
