## üîß Build Configuration

Your `vercel.json` is already configured correctly:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ What You'll See After Deployment

### Navigation Buttons Location:
1. **Top Sticky Bar**: Always visible with "Back to Home" and "Dashboard" buttons
2. **Hero Section**: Semi-transparent buttons on blue background
3. **Article View**: Navigation in article header

### Visual Appearance:
- **Blue Button**: "Back to Home" ‚Üí Routes to `/`
- **Gray Button**: "Dashboard" ‚Üí Routes to `/insights`
- **White Sticky Bar**: Contains help center title and navigation

## üß™ Testing the Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:
- **Help Center**: `https://your-site.vercel.app/help`
- **Home Navigation**: Click "Back to Home" button
- **Dashboard Navigation**: Click "Dashboard" button
- **Article Navigation**: Click any help article, then test navigation

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Buttons Still Don't Appear:
1. **Hard Refresh**: `Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache completely
3. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools for errors
4. **Verify Build**: Ensure latest build was deployed

### If Routing Doesn't Work:
- Vercel should handle SPA routing automatically
- Check that `vercel.json` rewrites are configured
- Ensure React Router is working locally first

## üìû Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Build Complete**: All files ready in `/dist`
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Implemented**: Sticky bars and buttons added
- ‚úÖ **Styling Complete**: Professional appearance
- ‚è≥ **Deployment Pending**: Manual deployment required due to config issues

- Professional styling
- Clear visual hierarchy  
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features
- Consistent branding

Your help center navigation issue will be completely resolved!
